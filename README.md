- Need to add an "application" for... hmm... something like "Operations" or
  more general improvements

- How about issues that touch multiple applications?
  - Primary application and allow for secondaries in another table?
  - Generate all combinations? ðŸ¤£
- Consider date and duration pickers and how to represent them in the buffer
  - Consider ISO 8601 duration standard
  - Also consider [this excellent library][howard-date]
- Add a field for "time actually completed" 
- Add integrity check for some things
  - If percentage is 100%, then we need to be in one of the "Finished" status
    categories
  - Make sure "time actually completed" is properly set if percentage is 100%
  - If there is a Gantt like or parent-child relation between two issues, we
    can constrain the proper values for the start, end, duration, and effort
    values
  - Some issue types might even have these values entirely computed from their
    children
  - Same thing for percentages, some percentages should be computed from their
    children, and I am unsure how to calculate this
- Have a date for when the ticket is actually created
- What to do about this interactive case where I am adding a lot of tasks?
  - For example, I want to have relationships between tasks
    1. What format should it be in the user interface when specifying these
       tasks?
    2. How can I create links between issues that are in this same batch and
       haven't been added yet?
       - Consider having a temporary holding table for the current batch, where
	 links can be established...
	 - IDs would change as we went along, so I'm not sure how this would
	   work...
	 - We could still have a temporary table, and rely on linking via
	   regexes that uniquely identify the summary of each issue... I think
	   something like this is the most straightforward way for now
	 - On second thought, I think it is reasonable to have the verbatim
	   summary in the batch relation
    3. One thing is determining how to establish the database link between the
       two. Another is how to allow referencing others in the batch in the
       description of the issue.

       Lately I have been partial to Markdown's "reference-like" link syntax. I
       wonder if relations can be specified at the end in a reference-like
       syntax, and referred to in the descriptions to be modified before
       insertion into the database.

Summary      : Date and time library based on the C++11/14/17 <chrono> header
URL          : https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date
License      : MIT
Description  : This is actually several separate C++11/C++14/C++17 libraries:
             :  - "date.h" is a header-only library which builds upon <chrono>.
             :    It adds some new duration types, and new time_point types. It
             :    also adds "field" types such as year_month_day which is a
             :    struct {year, month, day}. And it provides convenient means
             :    to convert between the "field" types and the time_point types.
             :  - "tz.h" / "tz.cpp" are a timezone library built on top of the
             :    "date.h" library. This timezone library is a complete parser
             :    of the IANA timezone database. It provides for an easy way to
             :    access all of the data in this database, using the types from
             :    "date.h" and <chrono>. The IANA database also includes data
             :    on leap seconds, and this library provides utilities to compute
             :    with that information as well.
             : Slightly modified versions of "date.h" and "tz.h" were voted into
             : the C++20 working draft.
