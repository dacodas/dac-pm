Consider taking over Elton's Windows Jenkins build machine

Elton seems to be struggling with keeping up to date with this Jenkins build
machine. Plus it is in AWS which he is not going to be monitoring. I have some
doubts about whether he should be in charge of this, and perhaps we can provide
a better experience to the build team. Let's start asking around

There are some decisions that we need to communicate with other departments on
and that need to be revisited further down the line. The main impetus for
wanting this space is the SWE build machines which are now temporarily in our
vSphere infrastructure, but that we have agreed should eventually be migrated
to Azure. This place would serve to record our agreement that we will be
migrating, and to update with information from our monthly, quarterly, or
biannual touch-bases.

Two other projects in a similar boat are the iConfig machines and the SVT
machines.

TeamForge had two issues with disk space running low and alerts not making it
to PagerDuty. There is quite a bit of conversation from 2022-02-17 that can be
transcribed here. For now, Dacoda just needs to confirm that the most basic,
for example, disk space alerts should be coming from Azure.

Add SolarWinds monitoring to Elastic and other Dacoda-managed Linux nodes

To do
Dacoda has learned that Solarwinds monitoring has to be configured on a
per-machine basis. Thanks to Vytautas's Ansible configurations, once the node
is added to SolarWinds, we get all of the monitoring for free, easy-peasy.

This task might also benefit from including monitoring for...

To do
While discussing the lack of alerts for TeamForge, we considered that perhaps
the virtual machine has been in an alerting state for as long as the
`/opt/collabnet` mount has been over it's threshold. In order to pursue this
theory, we would like to expand the disk space so that we aren't being
triggered.

Furthermore, we can use this task to create a new single disk with enough space
and `pvmove` LVM extents to the new disk in order to consolidate how many disks
we have attached to the machine.
